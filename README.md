# Motivation

Just a React exercise:

# Tech Stack

- [React](https://reactjs.org/): A JavaScript library for building user
  interfaces.
- [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app): Set
  up a modern web app by running one command.
- [IT Bookstore API](https://api.itbook.store/).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
